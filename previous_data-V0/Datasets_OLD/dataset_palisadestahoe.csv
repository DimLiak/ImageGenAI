Plus, in just 24 hours from Saturday morning to Sunday morning, we received more than 35 inches of snow ‚Äî the 6th largest snowfall total in 24 hours that we have on record. We got so much snow that we needed to dig out chairs at the top of KT, and dig out one of our grooming machines by hand.

We will start the day tomorrow with lower mountain lifts on the Palisades side; Resort Chair, First Ventures, Exhibition and KT-22. ‚õ∑Ô∏è Once the lower mountain is open, we'll shift our focus to opening some upper mountain terrain. üèÇ On the Alpine side, we're aiming to reopen Summit tomorrow, as well as Scott and Sherwood by midweek.

It‚Äôs a little strange to get more snow at the base than the upper mountain, but that can be explained best by yesterday's winds gusting up to 160mph!

High winds and heavy snowfall will continue through the day, before tapering off later this evening. At Alpine, we're projecting Subway, Roundhouse, Treeline Cirque (to the mid station), and Meadow will run today following delayed openings. Due to extremely low visibility and high avalanche danger, all lifts at Palisades are now closed for the day.

That‚Äôs 12 feet. We are BURIED in every sense of the word after one of the most intense storm cycles in recent memory ‚Äì and more snow is on the way. There are significant challenges that come with digging out from a storm like this one, not just on our mountains but also on our roadways and in our local towns. If you love the Tahoe area as we do, we need you to plan your travel accordingly before coming up. We want you to be aware of the reality of the current situation so that you can know what to expect and be prepared:

- Check the weather and road conditions before leaving for Lake Tahoe. The CalTrans QuickMap app is a great resource for checking highway status.
- Get fuel and groceries BEFORE you come up to the mountains. We are low on supplies as many trucks have not been able to get through.
- Bring a bag of supplies in your car with you. Road closures can be frequent during storm cycles, so you will want to have water, blankets, and food ready to go.
- Please be patient. There will be delays as our region recovers from this massive weather event. The operators working to clear roads and get us open again deserve your kindness and understanding.
 
For more information on what to expect with the incoming weather, please read our latest Operations Blog. [Link in bio + stories.]",[],15262,86,Palisades Tahoe,2023-03-03 00:58:50,GraphSidecar

Our teams have been working around the clock to dig us out and set up the mountains, and we are stoked to open more terrain over the next few days! This huge Sierra storm also caused a widespread power outage in the North Lake Tahoe area, and both of our base areas are currently without power. We are in touch with local utilities to resolve the issue and are hopeful to have power restored at the mountains by this evening. Once power is restored, here‚Äôs the opening plan (weather & conditions permitting):

‚ùÑÔ∏è Wednesday: Treeline Cirque, Red Dog, Resort Chair, and SnoVentures
‚ùÑÔ∏è Thursday: Roundhouse, Exhibition
‚ùÑÔ∏è Friday: Summit, Big Carpet
‚ùÑÔ∏è Saturday: Siberia, Gold Coast, Shirley Lake, Funitel, Aerial Tram, Belmont, Mountain Meadow, Bailey‚Äôs Beach

Please also be aware that per California state mandate that goes into effect December 15-January 15, face coverings are now required in all buildings‚Äîincluding lodges, restaurants, and shops. If you forget your mask, we will have extras upon entry.
