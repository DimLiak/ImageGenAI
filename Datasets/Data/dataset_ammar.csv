I got in a pretty bad car accident a few hours ago on my way back from skydiving training... my car spun out of control after getting rear ended and rolled off the highway 5 or 6 times into a bowl 30 ft down and about 200 ft out. I am safe and sound and currently home. Walked away with a small scratch on my hand and in full disbelief that I am still alive and not injured badly. Thankfully nobody else was hurt. Please send prayers of healing and protection. 🙏🏽 much love ❤️🌻 please be careful out there on the road.

I have become a dual citizen to Egypt 🇪🇬 and the Caribbean Island of Saint Kitts and Nevis. 🏝🇰🇳 If you’re familiar with my story then you know 2 things about me: 
1. I haven’t been able to go back to my home country Egypt for the past 4 years and I wouldn’t be able to go back until I am 30 years old (in 3 years) due to military service complications. 🚫
2. I need to apply for visas to travel anywhere with my Egyptian passport. And as a result I’ve missed over half the international trips that Yes Theory has taken over the past 6 years to tell stories from around the world. 🌍

This passport changes everything!!! With it I will be able to return to Egypt as soon as early 2022 to see my family inshaAllah and I will be able to travel to 155 countries visa free (including the Schengen EU counties 🇪🇺UK 🇬🇧, Russia 🇷🇺.. and many more)
If you’re curious about the process of how I did it then I’d recommend you watch the Yes Theory video we just made on this. 

I am eternally grateful for the love and unwavering support that Thomas, Matt, Tommy, Zack and Kate have shown me through it all…Thanks to the incredible global family that is the Yes Fam ⚡️ for believing in me/ us and standing by our side for the past few years .. I truly couldn’t have done it without you. 

The Free Child is now a Free Man! 
‎(الحمد لله)

Also to all my European and American friends! Please don’t take your passports for granted. 🙏🏽❤️",[],76418,1460,Brookes & Partners Citizenship Advisors,2021-11-14 19:49:13,GraphImage

I struggled with my mental health more than any other time in my life in that period.. but it also became evident to me that there was no way out except by going inwards and releasing what was no longer serving my soul and big dreams (still work in progress and will always be) .. In this very moment right now, I am happy, grateful and proud for persevering through it all. 

I have some great news to share in the next month or so. My life is about to change in a major way —to the better inshaAllah 🦋📈. (Not marriage haha)
