You were so much more than a high school principal, head basketball coach or senior pastor. You were my grandfather and you were larger than life.

Thank you for never missing a big game, birthday party or graduation. Thank you for baptizing me when I was 7 and marrying me when I was 22. Thank you for teaching me how to shoot a free throw, hit a golf ball and how to love my ‚Äòsweetie pie‚Äô with all that I have. Thank you for helping me fend off the invisible pirates at Pecan Park in Dallas with golf club shafts to keep Mimi and my cousins safe back home. Thank you for saying yes all 9 times to our last minute stereotypes filming and thank you for just being yourself while we filmed you.

But most of all, thank you for loving Jesus. The impact of that love was contagious not only to your family and friends but to strangers. Whether we were waiting in line to see a movie, eating at a restaurant or at a school function, you never held back, ‚ÄúHEY BUCK-A-ROO, what‚Äôs your name?!‚Äù You went on to have a full blown conversation with them until you knew everything about them and then ended the interaction with a big ole belly laugh, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just so happy because I know Jesus. Do you know him?‚Äù You we‚Äôre on a mission.

Those who knew you have a peace knowing that you are hanging out, dancing, and probably telling really loud, funny stories in heaven. Thank you Lord for letting us have Bruce Norman for 84 years... he was truly a blessing. I love you Big Dad... save me a tee time.",[],150215,5629,,2019-02-25 21:38:18,GraphSidecar
