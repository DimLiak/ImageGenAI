The only questions were how forcefully it would smash records, how many mountains of vinyl it would sell and how far down the chart Swift’s catalog would push everybody else.

“Speak Now (Taylor’s Version),” the third installment in Swift’s series of rerecorded albums — this one recreating “Speak Now” from 2010, with a thick appendix of tracks revisited from the cutting-room floor — is the year’s biggest new LP, notching the equivalent of 716,000 sales in the U.S. It easily topped Morgan Wallen’s “One Thing at a Time,” which opened with 501,000 in March.

But that is not all. It is Swift’s 12th No. 1 album, beating Barbra Streisand for the most chart-toppers by a woman. Drake also has 12 No. 1 albums, but the only acts with more are Jay-Z (14) and the Beatles (19).

The popularity of Swift’s Eras Tour has lifted her entire catalog, and this week, in addition to the new “Speak Now,” she has three other titles in the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 album chart: “Midnights” (No. 5), “Lover” (No. 7) and “Folklore” (No. 10). Swift is the first living act to have four albums in the Top 10 since Herb Alpert in 1966. (Prince had five after his death in 2016, and for many years Billboard barred older “catalog” albums from reappearing on its main chart — a rule that was changed after Michael Jackson’s death, in 2009.)

Around 4 p.m. on July 13, 488 dogs assembled on the broad lawn in front of the ruins of Guisachan House in the Scottish Highlands to take a group photo of the 2023 Guisachan Gathering, a kind of golden retriever convention, commemorating the anniversary of the founding of the breed.

Since the first group photo was taken in 2001, golden lovers have come together about every five years to pay homage to Sir Dudley Marjoribanks, later Lord Tweedmouth, who lived in what was then Guisachan House. Sir Dudley is credited with developing the golden retriever in 1868, when he bred a wavy-coated retriever with a tweed water spaniel. He wanted a rugged hunting companion with a beautiful head, a loving disposition and soft, melting eyes, a dog that lived to fetch game. An obsession with tennis balls and rolling in filth apparently also came with the package.

People and their dogs travel from around the world to take part in the Guisachan Gathering, and this year’s was the biggest yet. Represented this year were Ireland, Bavaria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the U.S., Australia, Canada and Croatia.

He clinched the Electoral College with Pennsylvania.⁣
⁣
Biden’s victory amounted to a repudiation of President Trump by millions of voters exhausted by his divisive conduct and chaotic administration, and was delivered by an unlikely alliance of women, people of color, old and young voters and a sliver of disaffected Republicans. Trump is the first incumbent to lose re-election in more than a quarter-century.⁣
⁣
With his triumph, Biden, who turns 78 later this month, fulfilled his decades-long ambition in his third bid for the White House, becoming the oldest person elected president. A pillar of Washington who prefers political consensus over combat, Biden is promising to restore political normalcy and a spirit of national unity to confront raging health and economic crises.⁣

The result also provided a history-making moment for Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, who will become the first woman to serve as vice president. ⁣

Wade, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion after almost 50 years in a decision that will transform American life, reshape the nation’s politics and lead to all but total bans on the procedure in about half of the states.

The ruling will test the legitimacy of the court and vindicate a decades-long Republican project of installing conservative justices prepared to reject the precedent, which had been repeatedly reaffirmed by earlier courts. It will also be one of the signal legacies of President Donald J. Trump, who vowed to name justices who would overrule Roe. All three of his appointees were in the majority in the 6-to-3 ruling.

The decision, which echoed a leaked draft opinion published by Politico in early May, will result in a starkly divided country in which abortion is severely restricted or forbidden in many red states but remains freely available in most blue ones.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. voted with the majority but said he would have taken “a more measured course,” stopping short of overruling Roe outright. The court’s three liberal members dissented.

The victims had been doing Saturday-afternoon shopping. They included a 65-year-old woman who was there to buy strawberries for shortcake and a 32-year-old woman who stopped by to pick up something for dinner. And there was the security guard, Aaron Salter Jr., 55, a retired Buffalo police officer.

During his 30 years as a police officer, Salter earned a reputation for bravery, with more than one of his exploits recorded in the local newspaper, The Buffalo News. He once chased down an arsonist, the newspaper reported, and on another occasion he faced down a burglar armed with a shotgun.

Salter retired in 2018, switching to a job that should have been far less treacherous: working as a security guard with the Tops supermarket in east Buffalo.

But on Saturday, Salter would once again encounter a situation that would test his bravery when a man — wearing body armor and camouflage gear and armed with an assault weapon — stormed into the supermarket and opened fire.

Salter confronted the gunman and fired back. But he became one of the 10 people, including three other store employees and several shoppers, who were killed. 

The names of the people fatally shot were released by the authorities on Sunday night. The people who were wounded included Christopher Braden, 55, of Lackawanna, New York; Zaire Goodman, 20, of Buffalo; and Jennifer Warrington, 50, of Tonawanda, New York.

Attenzione, pickpocket!”

Monica Poli, 57, who lives in Venice, has become prominent on social media for patrolling the streets of her hometown, calling out would-be pickpockets to tourists. She is part of a group known as the Cittadini Non Distratti — the undistracted citizens — that wanders the city shouting at people whom they believe to be thieves plucking wallets, passports and other items from the pockets of passers-by. Sometimes Poli and her fellow amateur watchdogs will report these suspected pickpockets to the police. In 2019, The Economist reported that the group was responsible for a third of all pickpocket arrests made in Venice.

The civilian group has been active for decades but only recently joined TikTok and Instagram, where hundreds of thousands of people follow along, thanks in large part to Poli’s unmistakable voice. Her shouts of “Attenzione, borseggiatrici! Attenzione, pickpocket!” have become a meme.
