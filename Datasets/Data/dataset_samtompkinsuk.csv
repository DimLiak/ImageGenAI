my dad was a lot of things. he was a friend, a confidant, a cheerleader, an advisor, a philanthropist. his voice like a great big warm hug at the end of a long hard day. he listened intently to my every word, problem, achievement and always met each one with a smile. his wisdom, his stories and his way with words crafted my whole artistic identity. i couldn‚Äôt make the music i make without him. my dad was my best friend. 

he will be sorely missed by everyone especially my siblings and i. I can‚Äôt even tell you how sad i am, i‚Äôm wiping the tears away from my eyes as i write this, but the reason i have decided to post this is that this has just given me the most violent nudge to remind you all (especially men) to fucking talk to each other, man. speak about your feelings, reach out to one another and don‚Äôt hold back. be free with your deepest darkest thoughts, speak to people. let them know you‚Äôre in pain. we have the opportunity to save a generation and beyond thinking this way. 

lastly, to my lovely dad. i am so sorry i couldn‚Äôt have been your friend growing up. i‚Äôm sorry we couldn‚Äôt go for a walk or a pint and i couldn‚Äôt turn to you and really ask you if everything is okay. let you know it‚Äôs alright to chat to me. Tell you all the brilliant things that you are and will become. and just how much you meant to the people who knew you, but i will continue to share your story and let people know just how special you truly were. i will always miss you. whenever anyone asks me ‚Äúhow‚Äôd you get that wonderful beard?‚Äù, i always say ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know, ask my dad‚Äù‚Ä¶. well i guess we will never know now.

i love you, dad. may you rest in glorious peace.

some turn invisible, but that‚Äôs not original. might not be invincible, but you‚Äôre still my hero, dad.

well, it‚Äôs been 5 years since i quit now and since then i have gone from busking on the street to doing 3 sold out uk tours, a european tour, had a project that wasn‚Äôt even an album, land at number 6 in the uk album charts, shared the stage with my favourite artist, travelled all over the world, worked with my hero‚Äôs, touched hearts and shared tears with thousands, if not millions of people and none of that happens without people caring enough about what i have to say to share it with people and spread it. i honestly can‚Äôt thank this family enough. i love you guys with my whole heart. thank you for being here and sticking around.",[],21584,472,,2023-07-15 18:44:14,GraphSidecar
