As you all know I like to remain fairly private, but I‚Äôm always happy to show off the people in my life I love the most.  So please know that any rude or mean comments will be deleted and blocked.  As I am trusting you, ‚Äúmy dearest fans‚Äù to be the loving people that I know you to be. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Finding someone you Love, Trust, Respect and is your best friend isn‚Äôt always easy. It takes time, (in my case 55 years) patience, lessons and ALOT of self growth to be ready for it when it arrives.  So when you find it ‚Äú and you will ‚Äú‚Ä¶ never take it for granted.  Be fearless, be vulnerable, and be true to yourself. 
When you‚Äôre a good person, it‚Äôs inevitable YOU WILL manifest the best people to compliment your life! ü•∞  She is as solid of a human as they come. And she is mine.  So say hello to the other half of me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

And to my gf Sarah for organizing an amazing dinner with the best of all my closest family and friends.  You all mean so so much to me. ‚ò∫Ô∏è But I will say the highlight of my night was having my daughter show up.  I‚Äôve realized that ‚Äútime‚Äù is my most valuable asset now.  And I don‚Äôt take it for granted anymore.  And we‚Äôve missed a lot of each other‚Äôs lives with the excessive amount of touring I‚Äôve had to do over the years.  It‚Äôs a very bitter-sweet that most of you will never understand trying to find that balance between the love you have for your child and not wanting to miss a stitch of those special moments, and the things you need to do to make sure they‚Äôll be ok in life.  It really does go by so quickly.  And if I could change anything, I would wind back that hands of time just to give those minutes back to her.  So I appreciate every single second I can get in with the most beautiful young lady I know in this world.  Thank you everyone for a great day, a very special night, and especially to #daddyslittlegirl for always being there for me.
