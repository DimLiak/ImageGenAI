This year has been incredibly rewarding personally and professionally and I am appreciative of everyone who worked their ass off to help our team achieve so much. 

I always want to win, I think that‚Äôs pretty apparent by now, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I equate losing to failure, especially when you go out fighting the way we did.. There‚Äôs so much to appreciate in a season like this when you‚Äôre surrounded by a team that believes in each other, and plays for the people standing on either side of them. I‚Äôll spare you the Man in the Arena quote, but that feeling is something that I promise I‚Äôll never take for granted. To everyone that was a part of it this year, thank you.

Because it meant you were locked in and it was playoff time. That was when you shined the most. On the biggest stage and in the biggest moments, you always came through. I was a witness to so much of the journey and am so proud of you and how you grew from 7th round underdog to an older 7th round underdog. The truth is, you never really grew up üòÇüòÇ! You never lost that chip on your shoulder. You never let anyone define you as a person or player. You have so many teammates that admired your work ethic and will to win, and I am at the top of the list because when I was down and feeling sorry for myself at times, you were right there to pick me up. You were as tough as could be and I love you for all that you did to make our teams as great as they could possibly be. 

Seeing you become a dad and the changes you made in your life made me so encouraged and happy for you. Life is about gratitude and perspective! I am so happy for you and your family. You had an amazing football journey, an amazing life journey in New England, and I have no doubt you will succeed in anything you choose to do next! LFG ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

After a few days of reflection, I am so grateful and humbled by the unconditional support you have shown me the past two decades. Running out of that tunnel every week is a feeling that is hard to explain. I wish every season ended in a win, but that‚Äôs not the nature of sports (or life). Nobody plays to lose. But the reward for working hard is just that, the work!! I have been blessed to find a career I love, teammates who go to battle with me, an organization that believes in me, and fans who have been behind us every step of the way. 
Every one of us that works at Gillette Stadium strived to do their best, spent themselves at a worthy cause, and prepared to fail while daring greatly (h/t Teddy Roosevelt). And for that, we‚Äôve been rewarded with something that the scoreboard won‚Äôt show - the satisfaction of knowing we gave everything to each other in pursuit of a common goal. That is what TEAM is all about. 
In both life and football, failure is inevitable. You dont always win. You can, however, learn from that failure, pick yourself up with great enthusiasm, and place yourself in the arena again. 
And that‚Äôs right where you will find me. Because I know I still have more to prove.",[],1308834,52963,,2020-01-08 13:50:32,GraphImage
