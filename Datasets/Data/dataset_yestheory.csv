Started the year off in the cold mountains of Poland doing the most extreme thing we’ve ever done. We arrived back in LA yesterday, and right now we’re on a flight headed to Tokyo to be a part of something truly legendary. We want you to be a part of it. We‘re unable to mention the details but basically we’re bringing the Yes Fam around the world to participate in an art installation at one of the most respected museums in the world. How many people can say that they’ve been a part of an art piece at a world class museum? Exactly!!! Not a lot.
What we want you to do is quite simple: Organize/ show up to a meet up in your city with yes fam members, stand in a circle holding hands then send us a video of it (the more creative the better -drone shots would be epic—this will be a part of a Yes Theory episode)... We can’t wait to share with you all the adventures but most importantly have you be a part of it. (Check out our IG story). First video of 2019 dropping on Jan 20th. 
Comment below what city you’re from and start connecting with people near you. 
Send your footage to be a part of the epic montage in the episode before January 18th: yesfamdots@gmail.com",[],159436,8025,Poland,2019-01-14 18:25:34,GraphImage

That’s a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride, and a marathon 26.22-mile (42.20 km) run. Seems like pure insanity to most of us.

This is a photo from right after he finished. And it is the epitome of everything Yes Theory stands for. It’s pursuance of a dream despite whatever adversities, obstacles, fears, or limitations stand in your way. 
What you don’t see in this picture are the early morning runs, the 6+ hour solitary bike rides, the boring salads he ate, or the festivals he missed. You don’t see how a guy went from struggling through his first half-Ironman to crushing his second. And then again how that same guy showed up in Santa Rosa and completed a sub-12 hour race (un-freaking-believable). Today, let Matt be your inspiration. Start pursuing that goal that you think is way too far outside your reach. Sign up for a local triathlon. Write the first page of your book. Commit to an Improv class. Do something that your future self will thank you for. Just start.

Our collective potential is so much higher than we think it is. We can push our bodies and minds much further than we think we can. But, as Matt’s shown us, it takes an insane dedication to reach those heights…

As I step away from making videos, I can’t help but look back at how this dream all unfolded.

When the guys and I started out on this adventure in the summer of 2015, we had no idea what would happen. We were looking for an alternative path. We felt that life was too short to not take massive risks. And to be honest, we sometimes wondered if we were crazy. Our friends and our family thought we’d lost our minds. While everyone else we knew was getting jobs, we were packed into a one bedroom apartment dressing up as Superheroes and running around Montreal.

And soon, you came in. One by one. First in views, then in likes, then in comments and eventually, in person. We began to see that we weren’t the only ones who felt this way. That we weren’t the only ones who thought that life should be a daring adventure. That it shouldn’t be taken too seriously. That discomfort was something to be pursued, not avoided. Your belief in the Yes Theory philosophy is what made Yes Theory what it is today.

As I look back at what we’ve accomplished in these five and a half years, the thing I am proudest of is you. There is no community like you online. The support you give each other is unheard of. The vulnerability you share with each other is unparalleled. Even when we’re not posting videos, you’re organizing events, launching ideas together, and even getting married. The Yes Fam is such a gift to this world. I hope you see it as much as I do. And I pray that you continue meeting up, dancing, and creating together. The world needs it more than ever. As for me, I’ll still be here, you just won’t see my face as much. I’ll be working hard behind the scenes to write this book that I wish I’d had when I was 19 and starting out on my life adventure. I’ll also be writing a short newsletter twice a month which will help you transform into the person you want to become. The link to sign up to that is in the bio.

This is not the end. Far from it. It’s part of the evolution.

Thank you for your endless love. Thank you for your dedication to this movement. And thank you for being you. May the journey continue.

Love, Matt",[],157814,1639,,2021-02-25 19:39:41,GraphSidecar

A few months before that we’d traveled to Afghanistan. 

It is needless to say that we have been watching the events in Ukraine and last summer in Afghanistan unfold with horror. Concerned for our friends we met and in disbelief that this is still happening in our lifetime.

To be honest, we’ve been struggling with knowing how to best respond in both of these situations. As we’ve tried to type captions and share our perspective, we feared to contribute to more noise on social media. So instead we decided to focus our internal efforts on what we could impact: to help the friends that we met on those trips reach safe areas.

It is heart-wrenching to see these conflicts arise around the world and seeing innocent people suffer. Yes Theory is a movement and community that will always stand for peace, empathy for each other and operates on the fundamental belief that we are a worldwide family.

As we also traveled to remote parts of Sakha Republic in Russia a month ago, we met some of the warmest people we’d ever encountered, it is clear that most of us simply want peace and to care for each other.

Aggression is never the answer, war is never the answer. Our hearts are with all of those impacted by this conflict.

September 25th, 2018.

@willsmith will be bungee jumping out of a helicopter with us on his 50th birthday.

Over the freaking Grand Canyon.

Live on @youtube .

And, a few days after it happens, something else will catch your attention. 
And you’ll move on.

But here’s why we want you to remember this event, this picture and this story.

Here’s why it’s important for you.

Because the jump isn’t the significant part.

It’s what it represents.

For all of us.

It represents a choice.

One we all have to make.

A daily decision…

Love or fear.

Discomfort or comfort.

Speaking the truth or staying quiet.

See, Will is terrified of heights.

He’s gonna be 50.

He’s got a family he loves.

He’s got one of the most successful careers in the history of entertainment.

And yet, he’s agreed to a stunt that’s only been done a handful of times.

He’s got all of the excuses in the world.

He could easily have ignored our challenge.

But this, like so many other times in his life, is his choice to fight that voice inside his head.

That reminds him why he can’t.

That throws excuses at him.

That says he’s got too much to lose.

This is a f*** you to that voice.

It’s a choice.

And the choice is yours as well. 
We want this stunt to be a reminder for you to make that decision.

To take the leap while looking fear directly in the face.

As Will once said, “I'm motivated by fear. Fear of fear. I hate being scared to do something. And I think what developed in my early days was the attitude that I started attacking things that I was scared of.” Let’s do this.

His liver cancer of five years had spread and there was nothing doctors could do. His wonderful cousin Estefany introduced us and when I met him, I didn’t know what to say. Cameras were on. I felt guilty for filming such an intimate and difficult experience. It was a lot. But he took it all in stride. He made me feel comfortable. He wanted to chat.

I learned that his dream was to start a YouTube channel. He said it’d be about his life, his love for cars, his love for Dragonball Z. He had so much love in him and all he wanted to do was share it with the world.

Yet as the months rolled on, the pain got worse. Every time I’d visit he was skinnier and had more difficulty moving. He’d go in and out of consciousness. But he soldiered on. He continued beating the odds, day after day.

The last time I went to see him before he passed away, it was different than usual. We opened up more. We spent two hours talking like old friends. And at one point, it got silent and we both started to cry. For 30 minutes it was water works. We knew this could be the last time. We held each other tight. Holding on, wishing the moment could last forever. That there would be no need to let go.

And writing this now, I miss him so much. I miss texting him at random hours of the day about my insignificant worries and being reminded by him every time about what matters. I miss his endearing laugh. I miss the way he was never afraid to tell the truth as he saw it.

In just three months he became not only my brother but my biggest inspiration. He won. He went past what anyone, any doctor, any expert, thought was possible. And I hope we all take a lesson from him. To love life so much that we set our own terms on it. To realize that each new day is a win. To hold each other tight and take it all in while we’re still here.

I know he’s up there cheering us on.

I know he's smiling.

Love you forever, Xavier Romero -Matt",[],136216,1252,,2020-02-09 19:00:04,GraphImage
