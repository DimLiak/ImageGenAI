Leading up into that season I was traded and then waived. But that’s wasn’t the end! I wrote down all my goals and one of those goals was to become a champion. I transformed my mind, I transformed my body, and became closer to God. Next thing you know the Lakers called and that year we won a championship.I manifested it! The same way I manifested being the #1 player in high school, the same way I manifested being the #1 pick in the draft! I envisioned the end goal and then worked towards it until I got there.  That’s the lesson ! If you want something believe that you can get it, go out and do the work, and surely you will see it !
