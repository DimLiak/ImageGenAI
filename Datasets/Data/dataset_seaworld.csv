He was transported to our rescue center in Orlando because of our extensive experience caring for young dolphins. Upon arrival, our veterinary team performed an exam and determined that he was hours to days old, making his rescue all the more critical for survival. We are happy to report he is swimming on his own and learning to take a bottle, but he is still considered to be in critical condition. This baby (and others like him) would not have a chance if not for the incredible rescue work and partnership of accredited zoological facilities and the Southeast Stranding Network who come together to do what is best for animals every day. We thank @epic_tails_charters who originally spotted him, @cmaquarium and @pascosheriffsoffice for transporting him to us for rehabilitation, and @noaafisheries for their leadership.",[],4190,114,,2023-05-15 18:12:01,GraphSidecar
