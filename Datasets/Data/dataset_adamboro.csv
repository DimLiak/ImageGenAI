  1. Hanging with the Maasai Tribe üåç these people live the most fascinating / unique lifestyles I‚Äôve seen. Whoever has the highest jump during their ritual dances legitimately ‚Äúgets the most wives‚Äù of the village
  2. Sunrise Hot Air Balloon over the Maasai Maraüéà‚òÄÔ∏è
 3. Hiking the actual place that inspired The Lion King ü¶Åüëë (Hell‚Äôs Gate National Park)
 4. Sunset in front of Mount Kilimanjaro. üåÑ All while taking selfies with zebras and flamingos, we watched the most beautiful sunset I‚Äôve seen all year. INSANE
  5. Singing and laughing on long road trips with new friends üöó

It‚Äôs crazy how with the internet we can just turn crazy concepts into reality.
