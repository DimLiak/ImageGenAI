Levi has been asking for spaghetti a lot lately, so I decided to mix it up! This time I made Pancetta & Eggplant Spaghetti with Fig Balsamic, featuring some of our favorites from @globalgardens 

The Basil EVOO in the sauce was freshly infused with real basil sourced directly from farmers, not fake flavoring, and the difference is soooo delicious. Then I made a reduction with this Fantastic Fig Balsamic to drizzle over top. Levi has been eating more sweets than usual since Halloween, so the inclusion of figs satisfied his sweet tooth and we were able to skip a dessert. In fact, the dish was already so flavorful that I didn't need to add my usual sprinkle of parmesan, either!

This time I made him a super seasonal dish featuring the trio of products we received in @globalgardens August Club Box. 

I seared the scallops in The Gold Standard EEVO (Yes! You can cook with real olive oil! It is the healthiest choice and the go-to oil for all of my recipes.) Then I reduced their Lime Chili Kick Golden Balsamic Vinegar to make a delicious glaze. I served the scallops over a simple seasonal salad of farm-fresh sweet corn, carrots, and cucumbers seasoned with nothing but the best olive oil and a pinch of salt. To replace Levi‚Äôs usual caviar topping, this time we went with the Counterfeit Caviar Really Good Mustard Seed Spread. He was surprised by the difference of flavor from briney to earthy salt. 

Global Garden‚Äôs quarterly Club Box is a great way to eat more seasonally; we love spicing up our usual dishes with their easy-to-use artisan offerings and look forward to each Box. You can find the link to sign up for their Club in our bio and get free shipping with code EATLIKELEVI üíö

Levi has been requesting a pear salad for a while now. I‚Äôd been mulling over the recipe for a few weeks, but nothing was hitting the mark. Then we tried this strawberry golden balsamic and ‚ÄúLevi‚Äôs Summer Salad‚Äù was born! 

The star of the recipe is an incredible vinaigrette featuring Strawberry Zen Golden Balsamic Vinegar & Nice to Meet You 100% Arbequina Cold Pressed EVOO from @globalgardens . They are the OG organically grown olive oil producers in Santa Barbara, CA, and genuinely the best we‚Äôve ever tried. The infusion of estate grown fruits in their oils and vinegars is so gourmet‚Ä¶ I kid you not, Levi was drinking this strawberry balsamic!
