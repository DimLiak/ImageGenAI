Having to say goodbye to our Matty has been an insane wave of emotions that I‚Äôve never experienced before. We all experience loss at some point in our lives. Loss of life or loss of love. Being able to really SIT in this grief allows you to feel the moments of joy and gratitude for having loved someone that deep. And we loved him deeply. He was such a part of our DNA. We were always the 6 of us. This was a chosen family that forever changed the course of who we were and what our path was going to be. For Matty, he KNEW he loved to make people laugh. As he said himself, if he didn't hear the ‚Äòlaugh‚Äô he thought he was going to die. His life literally depended on it. And boy did he succeed in doing just that. He made all of us laugh. And laugh hard. In the last couple weeks, I‚Äôve been poring over our texts to one another. Laughing and crying then laughing again. I‚Äôll keep them forever and ever. I found one text that he sent me out of nowhere one day. It says it all. (See the second slide‚Ä¶) 

Matty, I love you so much and I know you are now completely at peace and out of any pain. I talk to you every day‚Ä¶ sometimes I can almost hear you saying ‚Äúcould you BE any crazier?‚Äù 

Rest little brother. 
You always made my day‚Ä¶
