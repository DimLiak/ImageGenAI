The 1989 album changed my life in countless ways, and it fills me with such excitement to announce that my version of it will be out October 27th. To be perfectly honest, this is my most FAVORITE re-record I‚Äôve ever done because the 5 From The Vault tracks are so insane. I can‚Äôt believe they were ever left behind. But not for long!

The songs that came from this time in my life were marked by their brutal honesty, unfiltered diaristic confessions and wild wistfulness. I love this album because it tells a tale of growing up, flailing, flying and crashing ‚Ä¶ and living to speak about it. With six extra songs I‚Äôve sprung loose from the vault, I absolutely cannot wait to celebrate Speak Now (Taylor‚Äôs Version) with you on July 7th. Pre-order now at TaylorSwift.com üíúüíúüíú

I remember making tracklist after tracklist, obsessing over the right way to tell the story. I had to be ruthless with my choices, and I left behind some songs I am still unfailingly proud of now. Therefore, you have 6 From The Vault tracks! I recorded this album when I was 32 (and still growing up, now) and the memories it brought back filled me with nostalgia and appreciation. For life, for you, for the fact that I get to reclaim my work. Thank you a million times, for the memories that break our fall. üí•üêâüè∞ Speak Now (MY VERSION!) is out now.
