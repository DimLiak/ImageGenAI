Thank you Ritchy for touching my life the way you did. So many great stories over the years. I loved the way you snatched the M1 Garand out of my hands, and lifted it up and down a couple times, and told me ‚ÄúI remember these being heavier‚Äù. Also thanks for the pic with my Thompson, also letting me know it‚Äôs the wrong magazine. I think my best memory is one time we were talking on the porch. Right in the middle of the conversation. You glanced over at your ‚Äò70 Monte Carlo(that you bought new) in the driveway and noticed it wasn‚Äôt parked straight. You proceeded to get up off the porch. Start the car, let it warm up for five minutes. Then spend the next 7 minutes going back and forth in the driveway, gunning the motor between Drive and Reverse. Making sure it was absolutely straight and exactly in the middle. I think I like that story because it showed me what kind of man you were. Non compromising and Oh so determined. Cars need to be straight in the god damn driveway! I agree 100%. Rest In Peace Mr Overton. #jessejames",['jessejames'],78527,1001,East Austin,2018-12-28 02:55:44,GraphSidecar

That thing isn‚Äôt something that we need or really want to to do. But we without a doubt have to do it with all our heart. This was definitely one of those things. 
Hanging out with Jessi a year ago, and filming some shows for Discovery. I never thought she would be overwhelming my thoughts and heart like she has for the last couple weeks. Without a doubt this is the emotionally hardest piece of metal I have ever had to shape. Not because of the skills or labor involved. It because of what it is and what it symbolizes, and who‚Äôs ashes it will hold forever.  I had no plan, no patterns, no design ideas. I simply cut a circle of copper and started hammering. I let the metal dictate what it wanted to be. Thinking about her every step of the way and what she would like, and what she would think about it. Hoping I gave it the right amount of love, blood, sweat and tears. 
Thank you Terry for the honor of letting me do this. I hope in some way it makes your pain a little lighter.
