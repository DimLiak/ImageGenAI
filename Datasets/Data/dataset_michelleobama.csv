My home is my family. My home is Barack. 

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîour marriage has never been perfectly 50-50. One of us is always needing more or giving more. We have to be willing to listen to each other, honestly and without defensiveness. Only then, can we evolve together.

Over the years, a lot of young people have asked me about marriage. And my response usually goes something like this: You have to prepare yourself for long stretches of discord and discomfort. You have to learn how to make real compromises in the way you‚Äôve lived as an individual. Glamorizing a relationship while you‚Äôre dating will lead you straight to difficulty once you‚Äôre married. You can‚Äôt paper over problems when you‚Äôre living with someone day in and day out. 

So you‚Äôve got to ask yourself: What are you trying to get out of this relationship? Have you truly thought it through? Do you want a wedding or do you want a lifelong partnership? Those are two very different things. Together, you are answering the question: Who are we and who do we want to be?

Now I want to hear from you. What advice would you share about marriage or relationships? #TheLightWeCarry",['thelightwecarry'],5894325,44206,,2022-11-25 20:02:00,GraphImage

After a disturbing era of chaos and division, we are entering the next chapter of American leadership with the inauguration of @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Right now, I‚Äôm feeling more than just relief at putting the past four years behind us. I‚Äôm feeling genuinely hopeful for what‚Äôs to come.
 
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are the kind of leaders our nation deserves‚Äîdecent, hardworking people who reflect the best of our values. Most of all, they‚Äôre guided by empathy, honesty, and a willingness to put the needs of our country before their own. They‚Äôre determined to make life better for all Americans, and I know they will bring us back the stability that has been sorely lacking through what has been a devastating pandemic. Not to mention, we‚Äôll have terrific examples of leadership in @DrBiden and @DouglasEmhoff, as our new First Lady and Second Gentleman.
 
It‚Äôs no secret that the work ahead will be challenging. And no one person, even a president, is capable of waving a magic wand and fixing the problems that persist in this country. But this past year I‚Äôve seen folks from all over America step up like never before, whether it was peacefully protesting against racial injustice, registering first-time voters, or simply making sure a neighbor could safely get their groceries. It feels like we might finally be getting some momentum. And with @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris in the White House, we can once again start thinking about building the future we want for ourselves and our children.

Our country sorely needs it.

Thank you to all of you who poured every ounce of your hope and determination into this democracy over these past four years, registering voters, getting them to the polls, keeping folks informed. More votes were cast in this election than ever before. It‚Äôs because of you.

And after we celebrate ‚Äî and we should all take a moment to exhale after everything we‚Äôve been through ‚Äî let‚Äôs remember that this is just a beginning. It‚Äôs a first step. Voting in one election isn‚Äôt a magic wand, and neither is winning one. Let‚Äôs remember that tens of millions of people voted for the status quo, even when it meant supporting lies, hate, chaos, and division. We‚Äôve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us.

But we‚Äôve also got to recognize that the path to progress will always be uphill. We‚Äôll always have to scrape and crawl up toward that mountaintop. And two years from now, four years from now, there will once again be no margin for error. We see now the reality that we can‚Äôt take even the tiniest part of our democracy for granted. Every single vote must count ‚Äî and every single one of us must vote. And as a country, we should be making it easier, not harder to cast a ballot.

So it‚Äôs up to us to stay engaged and informed, to keep speaking out and marching on. We‚Äôve got to vote in even greater numbers in the upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia ‚Äî and every state and local election going forward. We‚Äôve got to promise each other that our focus in this election won‚Äôt be an anomaly, but the rule. That‚Äôs how we can not only feel this way right now, but in the months and years ahead. It‚Äôs the only way we‚Äôll build a nation worthy of our children. 

My warmest congratulations again to Joe and Jill, Kamala and Doug ‚Äî and each of you who stepped up when your country needed you.",[],3961157,33759,,2020-11-07 18:32:11,GraphImage

Hillary Clinton had just been dealt a tough loss by a far closer margin than the one we‚Äôve seen this year. I was hurt and disappointed‚Äîbut the votes had been counted and Donald Trump had won. The American people had spoken. And one of the great responsibilities of the presidency is to listen when they do. So my husband and I instructed our staffs to do what George and Laura Bush had done for us: run a respectful, seamless transition of power‚Äîone of the hallmarks of American democracy. We invited the folks from the president-elect‚Äôs team into our offices and prepared detailed memos for them, offering what we‚Äôd learned over the past eight years.

I have to be honest and say that none of this was easy for me. Donald Trump had spread racist lies about my husband that had put my family in danger. That wasn‚Äôt something I was ready to forgive. But I knew that, for the sake of our country, I had to find the strength and maturity to put my anger aside. So I welcomed Melania Trump into the White House and talked with her about my experience, answering every question she had‚Äîfrom the heightened scrutiny that comes with being First Lady to what it‚Äôs like to raise kids in the White House.

I knew in my heart it was the right thing to do‚Äîbecause our democracy is so much bigger than anybody‚Äôs ego. Our love of country requires us to respect the results of an election even when we don‚Äôt like them or wish it had gone differently‚Äîthe presidency doesn‚Äôt belong to any one individual or any one party. To pretend that it does, to play along with these groundless conspiracy theories‚Äîwhether for personal or political gain‚Äîis to put our country‚Äôs health and security in danger. This isn‚Äôt a game. So I want to urge all Americans, especially our nation‚Äôs leaders, regardless of party, to honor the electoral process and do your part to encourage a smooth transition of power, just as sitting presidents have done throughout our history.",[],3661793,74897,,2020-11-16 19:00:21,GraphImage
