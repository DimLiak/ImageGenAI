⁣
Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV. ⁣
⁣
A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much. From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson’s Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and several more, all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. ⁣
⁣
It was the honor of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Panther. ⁣
⁣
He died in his home, with his wife and family by his side. ⁣
⁣
The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time. ⁣

Just two weeks ago it was announced that the inimitable @phyliciarashad will serve as Dean of the new College of Fine Arts, and today we are pleased to announce that the re-established college will be named in honor of our king. 

Chad, you exemplify Howard’s core values of excellence, leadership, service, and truth. There is no one more deserving of such an honor.

We are so proud of you, we love you, and we miss you every day.

Congratulations to all the future students of the Chadwick A. Boseman College of Fine Arts!
