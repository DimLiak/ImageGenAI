Chris Mburu‚Äôs life was dramatically transformed by a stranger's small act of kindness when he was a child growing up in a small village in #Kenya.

His family couldn't afford his education. That was until Holocaust survivor Hilde Back, from #Sweden, offered to pay for him to go to school.

After attending Harvard and starting his first job as a human right lawyer at the #UnitedNations, Chris wanted to give back. Having found his long-lost childhood benefactor, Hilde, he set up a scholarship in her name to put Kenyan children through school.

‚ÄúWhen I look at poverty, it evokes memories of my own childhood. What keeps me going is the desire to keep as many people as possible out of poverty, because I remember my past, and where I was. I really do not want to see anybody there,"" he says.

In the new season of our podcast 'Awake At Night', Chris, who is now the UN Resident Coordinator in the Republic of Congo, reflects on his own path out of poverty, the transformational power of development and the ripple effect of compassion.

Wednesday is International Day of Peace, which is an opportunity to call attention to the need to end racism to build a more peaceful world. 

""Racism robs people of their rights and dignity. It inflames inequalities and mistrust, and it pushes people apart at a time when we should be coming together, as one human family, to repair our fractured world,"" said #UnitedNations Secretary-General @antonioguterres on #PeaceDay.

We all have a role to play in fostering peace -- and taking action to #FightRacism is a crucial way to contribute.

I am deeply saddened at the passing of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, who the world will remember for her unwavering leadership and lifelong dedication to serving her people.

She was a good friend to the #UnitedNations and a reassuring presence throughout decades of sweeping change, widely admired for her grace, dignity, and devotion.

I extend my condolences to her family, the Government and people of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the wider Commonwealth of Nations.
