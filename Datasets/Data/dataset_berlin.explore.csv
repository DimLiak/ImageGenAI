They have employed therapy dogs! These furry friends are specially trained to provide calming interactions with passengers before their flights, helping them feel more relaxed and at ease. 

📍 BER is the first airport in Germany to initiate this ""paw patrol"" project, following successful trials in the US. The therapy dogs from Brandenburg and der Havel offer passengers the opportunity to spend 10 minutes interacting with them, ensuring a peaceful state of mind before boarding their flights. The airport is currently in the test phase, but if all goes well, these adorable canines could become regular freelancers, providing their much-needed services every month. It's essential for the well-being of these therapy dogs that they receive breaks after working for an hour to ensure their comfort and happiness. ✨

This step forward not only makes it easier for foreigners living and working in Germany to become citizens, but also paves the way for a diverse and vibrant community.

According to SDP member Daniela Behrens, """"Germany needs regulated migration to strengthen its economy."""" And she's right! With its rich history, stunning landscapes, and thriving cities, Germany has long been a destination for travelers and professionals alike.

Imagine immersing yourself in the vibrant culture of Berlin, exploring the fairytale castles of Bavaria, or savoring the culinary delights of Munich. And now, with the new citizenship law, you can even consider calling this incredible country your home. While the law is set to be enforced from April 2024, it's important to remember that the application process for German citizenship can be lengthy.
