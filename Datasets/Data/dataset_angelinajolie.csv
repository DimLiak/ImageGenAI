So I’ve come on Instagram to share their stories and the voices of those across the globe who are fighting for their basic human rights.
 
--

I was on the border of Afghanistan two weeks before 9/11, where I met Afghan refugees who had fled the Taliban. This was twenty years ago.
 
It is sickening to watch Afghans being displaced yet again out of the fear and uncertainty that has gripped their country. 

To spend so much time and money, to have blood shed and lives lost only to come to this, is a failure almost impossible to understand.

Watching for decades how Afghan refugees - some of the most capable people in the world - are treated like a burden is also sickening. Knowing that if they had the tools and respect, how much they would do for themselves. And meeting so many women and girls who not only wanted an education, but fought for it.

Like others who are committed, I will not turn away. I will continue to look for ways to help. And I hope you’ll join me.

From protecting the environment to fighting inequality and discrimination, they are stepping in to do the work adults should but so far have failed to do. And in refugee camps and conflict areas globally, children are bearing the burden of the consequences of those bad decisions. 

When children and young people have the agency, power and knowledge to speak up, they can change the lives of both young people and adults, helping to achieve a more equal society. 

That is the message of our new book, Know Your Rights and Claim them, which was written in consultation with young activists around the world - and is for them, and all the many young people fighting for their rights globally.

Not out of charity, but out of a deep respect for them and their families, and all they continue to overcome, despite so much persecution, inequality and injustice.

Today, 1% of the world’s population - 82.4 million people - is displaced. That’s nearly twice as many as a decade before. 

Some crises, like the war in Afghanistan, have lasted for decades. 

Others, like the conflict in Ethiopia, are more recent.

They all have in common the violence and denial of rights that leave innocent families with no choice but to flee. 

At which point will we be concerned enough to address the environmental devastation, conflict and human rights abuses that fuel these crises? 

I’m always continuing to learn – if you’d like to join me, please visit the UN @refugees account.

All we needed was one adult to do the right thing.” Sending support and respect to them, and to all who are reliving this trauma so that system reforms can occur. 

I was on Capitol Hill this week, engaging with Senators on the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization and FBI reforms, including better protections for abused children, non-biased forensic evidence collection, trauma care, and judicial training.
