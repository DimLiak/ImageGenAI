Not exaggerating when I say that during the stick season album process we would finish a song and I’d listen back and be like “can you imagine kacey on this??”. Having her sing on she calls me back is incredible, and being able to have her continue telling the story adds a whole new dimension to the song and what it means. I’m so grateful and honored, continually humbled that artists of this level have lent their voice to this album. Kacey is cool as hell, brilliantly talented, and represents everything I love about music. She is a true artist and I can’t thank her enough for being a part of this song",[],494621,902,,2023-10-06 04:04:32,GraphSidecar
